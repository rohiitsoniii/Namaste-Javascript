lets start javascript fro interview prepration with akshay saini by his namaste js series ..

Question 1:- how js code is run  


To understand how JavaScript code runs, we need to explore several key concepts like the **Execution Context**, **Call Stack**, **Memory Heap**, and the **Event Loop**. Let's break it down:

### 1. **Execution Context**
   The **Execution Context** is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. There are two main types of execution contexts:
   - **Global Execution Context (GEC):** This is created when the script starts to execute. It handles code that’s not inside any function.
   - **Function Execution Context (FEC):** Every time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created for that function.

   Each execution context has two phases:
   - **Creation Phase:** Before the code runs, JavaScript engine creates the context. During this phase:
     - Variables and functions are allocated memory.
     - Variables are initialized with `undefined` (known as **hoisting**).
     - Functions are stored in memory with their definitions.
   
   - **Execution Phase:** Once the creation phase is complete, the code is executed line by line, and the actual values are assigned to variables.

   **Execution Context** contains three key components:
   - **Variable Environment:** Where variables and function declarations are stored.
   - **Lexical Environment:** The environment that includes the current execution context and its outer environment.
   - **`this` Binding:** Refers to the value of `this` within the context (e.g., in the global context, `this` refers to the global object like `window` in browsers).

### 2. **Call Stack**
   The **Call Stack** is a data structure that manages the execution contexts. It keeps track of which function is currently being executed and which function called it.

   - When the JavaScript engine encounters a script, it creates a Global Execution Context and pushes it to the call stack.
   - Each time a function is invoked, a new Function Execution Context is created and pushed onto the stack.
   - When a function completes its execution, it’s popped off the stack, and the engine continues with the previous execution context.

   **Example of Call Stack in action:**
   ```js
   function a() {
     console.log("Inside a");
     b();
   }
   
   function b() {
     console.log("Inside b");
   }
   
   a();
   ```
   - The Global Execution Context is pushed onto the stack first.
   - When `a()` is called, a new execution context for `a` is pushed.
   - Inside `a()`, `b()` is called, and a new context for `b` is pushed.
   - Once `b()` completes, its context is popped, and control goes back to `a()`.

### 3. **Memory Heap**
   The **Memory Heap** is where memory allocation happens for objects and variables. JavaScript uses it to store objects, arrays, and functions. It's an unstructured region of memory where data is stored and accessed.

### 4. **Event Loop and Callback Queue**
   JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute one task at a time. To handle asynchronous operations (like fetching data or timers), it uses an **Event Loop** and a **Callback Queue**.

   - **Call Stack**: Executes synchronous code, one frame at a time.
   - **Callback Queue**: Holds the callback functions for asynchronous tasks (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.) once they are ready to be executed.

   The **Event Loop** constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first task from the callback queue and pushes it onto the stack for execution.

   **Example of Asynchronous Code Execution:**
   ```js
   console.log('Start');

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('Inside timeout');
   }, 1000);

   console.log('End');
   ```
   - The synchronous code (`Start`, `End`) is executed first.
   - The `setTimeout` callback is placed in the callback queue and only executed after the stack is empty and 1000ms has passed.

### 5. **Hoisting**
   During the creation phase of the execution context, variable and function declarations are hoisted. This means that variables are set to `undefined`, and function declarations are stored before the actual execution begins.

   **Example:**
   ```js
   console.log(a); // undefined
   var a = 5;
   ```
   The variable `a` is hoisted to the top, and it’s initialized with `undefined` before the code runs.

### 6. **Lexical Environment and Scope Chain**
   Every execution context has a **Lexical Environment**. This environment contains all the variables, function declarations, and references to its parent environment, creating the **Scope Chain**. This helps JavaScript determine where to find variables based on the scope in which they were declared.

   - **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside any function.
   - **Function Scope:** Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function.
   - **Block Scope:** Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block `{}` are block-scoped and can't be accessed outside the block.

### 7. **Closures**
   A **Closure** happens when a function remembers its lexical environment even when it is executed outside its original context.

   **Example:**
   ```js
   function outer() {
     var a = 10;
     return function inner() {
       console.log(a); // It remembers 'a' from outer
     };
   }

   var closureFunc = outer();
   closureFunc(); // Outputs: 10
   ```

   In this case, even after `outer()` has finished execution, the inner function retains access to the `a` variable, forming a closure.

### Summary
- **Execution Context**: Created for global and function executions, handling variable initialization and code execution.
- **Call Stack**: Keeps track of function calls and their order of execution.
- **Memory Heap**: Stores objects and variables.
- **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous code execution, checking the call stack and callback queue.
- **Hoisting**: Moves declarations to the top during the creation phase.
- **Lexical Environment**: Determines variable accessibility via the scope chain.
- **Closures**: Functions retain access to variables from their parent scope even after the parent function has finished executing.

This entire mechanism enables JavaScript to efficiently run and manage both synchronous and asynchronous code.
